block_birth:
    title: Born
    date:  December 11, 1953
    text: >
        Andrey Makarevich was born in Moscow and spent his childhood years in Volkhonka, in a communal apartment of a
        house that once belonged to the Volkhonsky princes, across from the Pushkin Museum of Visual Arts. Later the
        family moved to the Komsomolsky Prospekt into a separate apartment

block_childhood:
    title: Childhood
    text: >
        As a child Andrey dreamed of becoming a diver and herpetologist, and put together a huge collection of butterflies,
        read a lot of books and loved helping his father draw. Thanks to his father as well, Andrey became accustomed
        to listening to music, which was always playing in his house: both records and live classical music -- Vadim
        Grigorievich was a superb piano player. Andrey was also placed in a music school to study piano, but he quit
        before completing three years there. But at 12 years old he independently began studying guitar -- his decision
        was prompted by hearing the music of Bulat Okudzhava

block_education:
    title: School
    first:
        years: 1960 - 1970
        text: >
            Andrey Makarevich studied at the 19th Moscow school (a specialized school with a focus on English), where
            during the last years of his time there, after hearing the Beatles in 1966, Andrey became a Beatles fan,
            like many of his peers. That was when the band Mashina Vremeni was conceived and started. Initially the
            school band that Andrey played and sang in was called The Kids and performed covers of songs in English

    second:
        years: 1969
        text: >
            Together with his Beatles-loving classmates Alexander Ivanov, Pavel Ruben, Igor Mazayev and Yuri Borzov,
            and later with Sergey Kavagoe (a student from a nearby school), Andrey formed Mashina Vremeni, which,
            having transitioned through so many members, exists to this day. Much of Andrey’s life and artistic work is
            tied to this band. For almost 50 years now he has been its undying frontman, the author of the majority of
            its lyrics, as well as the composer of a significant portion of its songs

    fourth:
        years: 1974
        text: >
            Expelled (factually because of an internal party directive, due to forbidden involvement in rock music),
            after which he found a job as an architect at the Giproteatr (“State institute of planning for theaters and
            entertainment structures”), where he worked up until 1979. In 1975 he was accepted back at MARKHI
            (Moscow Architectural Institute), finished school in 1977 and received an architect’s degree. However, all
            of that time his primary work was with Mashina Vremeni

    year:     1979
    part_1: >
        A contract was signed with Roskoncert, which gave the band an official status, and from that day Andrey left
        the Giproteatr and officially became a musician and performer. In the following years he would spend a huge
        amount of time touring throughout the USSR. Together with the band he was in the films “Dusha” [Soul] (1982) and
        “Nachni snachala” [Begin Again] (1986), where he played the lead role
    part_2: >
        In that same period of time, their first record, “Okhotniki za udachey” [Luck Hunters] came out illegally in the
        US, without any involvement or knowledge on part of the band. Starting in 1980 the band was involved in a series
        of futile discussions with the record company Melodiya. Their first album, “V dobryy chas” [Good luck] came out
        in 1986. From then on, records started coming out regularly

            Andrey periodically held solo concerts in a typical “bard” manner -- with no accompanying musicians, with
            one acoustic guitar, where he performed his own songs, not written for Mashina Vremeni. Most of them are
            recorded as part of his solo discography
    second:
        years: 1990-е
        text: >
            Andrey took part in recording albums with the band Kvartal and produced Yuz Aleshkovskiy’s album “Okurochek”
            [Cigarette Butt]. In that period he put out a few collections of poems and some books

            plays jazz, blues, bossanova, rumba, swing and chanson. OKT brought together musicians from a number of

            along with the “Yevgeniy Borets trio” and the Brill Brothers, in a completely new role -- as a jazz musician
            and performer. The project includes vocalists I. Rodiles, P. Kasianova, D. Polenova and E. Beriashvili

    third:

            In 2013 together with the ensemble “ACAPELLA EXPRESS”, the Yevgeniy Borets trio and trumpet player
            K. Gevondian, the project “LOVE pesni pro lyubov” [LOVE songs about love] was created, and in 2014,
            “Dzhazovye Transformacii” released the program “Idish-dzhaz” [Yiddish Jazz]. Both programs were hugely
            successful in Russia, Israel and the US

        The Makarevich bloodline comes from the Belorussian area. Starting in 1915, Andrey’s ancestors began living in
        Moscow
    second: >
        Underground performances by Mashina Vremeni in suburban clubs and the reproduction of recordings from those
        concerts through cassette players made the band famous throughout the country
